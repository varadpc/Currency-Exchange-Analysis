Currency Exchange Analysis

Overview
This project analyses historical GBP to INR exchange rate data from 2015 to 2024, performs various data visualisations, and uses Facebook's Prophet model to forecast future exchange rates.
Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualisations
Time series decomposition
Exchange rate forecasting using Prophet
Model accuracy evaluation

Results:
The project provides several insights and results:
Visualisation of GBP to INR conversion rate over time (2015-2024).

Model accuracy metrics:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 1.35
MSE (Mean Squared Error): 3.13
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 1.77
R2 Score: 0.93

These metrics indicate that our model performs well. A high R2 score of 0.93 suggesting that it explains 93% of the variance in the data. The low MAE and RMSE values also indicate good predictive performance.
